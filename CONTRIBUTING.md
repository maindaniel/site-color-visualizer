# Contributing to Site Color Visualizer
SCV is open source! Please feel free to contribute in any of the following ways:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Asking other questions

All of these actions should be done through a Github Issue in the repo.

## Submitting a fix
All proposed code fixes must come in the form of a pull request.

Unfamiliar with the process? Here is an example:
1. Clone or fork the repo.
2. Create your branch from `master`.
3. Add your code.
4. Make sure your code lints and rougly follows the set styling.
5. Push and create the pull request!

## Reporting a bug
When creating an issue for a bug report, please write:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

Since this is a smaller project, I'm not too picky about how bug reports are formatted. That being said, a maintainer may request more info if there is not enough information.

## Proposing new features
For proposing new features, please write an issue with the following:
- A quick summary of what is wanted to be added.
- Reason for wanting to see feature added.
- Any ideas you'd like to share on how to implement.
- Any other notes, pictures, graphs, or comments to better explain the feature!
